###GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls any of the following, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn:
  1. Snake Eyes
  1. Two consecutive ONES on the same Dice
  1. Two SIXES in one roll
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points, or the points equal to the value in the bottom left corner in their GLOBAL score wins the game
